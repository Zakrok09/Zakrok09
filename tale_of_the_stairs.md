_Who are you?_ - asked the Devil.

_I am a plebian by birth and all ragged folk are my brothers! Oh, how ugly the world is and how misrable the people are!_

This is what a young man spoke with his head high and his fists clentched. He stood in front of the stairs - a high 
set of stairs made of white marble with pink details. His gaze was fixed far away - where the masses flowed in misery
like the muddy waters of a river. They were stirring, seething briefly, raising an entire forest of dry, dirty hands 
and unrest. Furious shouts shook the air around and the echo faded away slowly, proudly, like cannon shots from far away. The
crowds grew, clouds of yellow dust were coming, different silhouettes began to take shape in the midst of the gray 
scene. An old man was coming, bent low to the ground, like he was searching for his lost days of youth. A barefoot girl
was dragging on his ragged clothes and watched the high stairs with his calm, cornflower-blue eyes. She watched and
smiled. And after them, more and more gray, dry figures in rags sang a drawn-out, funeral song. One whistled,
another laughed loudly with his hands in his pockets and insanity blazing in his eyes.

_I am a plebian by birth and all ragged folk are my brothers! Oh, how ugly the world is and how misrable the people are!
Oh you up there! You..._

This is what a young man spoke with his head high and his fists clentched.

_You hate those who are up there?_ - asked the devil well and deceitfully

_Oh, I will have my revenge on this princes and kings. And cruely so, for the sake of my brothers who have sickened 
faces like they are made of wax, who groan more ominously than the blizzards in December! Look at their bleeding bodies,
listen to their groans of pain! I will have my revenge in their name! Let me go!_

The devil smiled - _I am a guardian of those who are above. Without a bribe, I won't betray them._

_I do not have any gold, I do not have anything to bribe you with... I am just a poor youngster in rags... But
I am ready to give you my own life!_

The devil smiled again - _Oh, I don't want that much! Just let me have your hearing._

_My hearing? Sure... If I have to never hear again, so be it..._

_You will still be able to hear!_ - the devil comforted him - _You can go!_

The young man started running, jumped over three steps but the hairy hand of the devil caught him:

_Enough! Stay here and listen to the groans of your brothers!_

He listened. Strange... Why did everyone suddenly start singing happily and laughing so lightly?... He started running
upstairs again. The devil stopped him:

_To go three more steps, I will have to take your eyes!_

The young man desperately replied:

_But then I won't be able to see my brothers, nor the people who I want to take my revenge on!_

The devil said: _You will still be able to see... I will give you different, much better eyes!_

The young man ran the next three steps and looked down. The devil reminded him:

_Look at the "bleeding bodies"!_

_Oh lord! But this is so strange! When did they manage to get such beautiful clothes? And the bleeding sores? They are
just wonderful roses now!..._

On every third step, the devil took his small toll. But the young man continued walking. He readily gave up everything
just as long as he could reach up there and take his revenge on these fat princes and kings. It was just one single
step left and he would reach it! He must take his revenge and redeem his brothers!

_I am a plebian by birth and all ragged folk are..._

_Young man, you are just one step away! Just one step and you will finally have your revenge! But for this step
I always take a double toll: give me your heart and your memories!_

The young man declined:

_My heart? No! That is too cruel!_

The devil laughed loudly, with a feeling of authority.

_I am not that cruel! I will give you a heart made of gold and new memories in exchange! If you don't accept this,
you will never make it pass this step, you will never take your revenge for the sake of your brothers - those
with the sickened faces, who groan more ominously than the blizzards in December._

The young man looked the devil in his green, sly eyes.

_But I will be the most miserable! You are taking everything human I have left!_

_Quite the opposite! You will be the happiest!... But? Do you agree: it's just your heart and your memories?_

The young man pondered. A dark shadow appeared on his wrinkled forehead. His forehead from which muddy drops of sweat 
fell. He clenched his fists furiously and gritted his teeth:

_So be it! Take them!_

... and then, like a storm in the summer, full of anger and wrath with his black hair blown out, he crossed the final
last step. He was finally up there. Suddenly, a smile appeared on his face, his eyes shined with calm happiness, his
fists relaxed. He looked at the feasting princes, he looked down, where the gray crowds were stirring and cursing.
He looked but not a single muscle moved on his face: it was bright, cheerful, satisfied. He was looking at the 
festively dressed crowds, the groans were already songs of joy.

**_Who are you?_ - asked the Devil.**

_**I am a prince by birth and all gods are my brothers! Oh, how beautiful the world is and how happy the people are!**_
